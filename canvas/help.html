      <b>      Drawing Canvas Help &amp; Info:
</b>
      <br />
      This tool lets you draw and plan UIs and graphics for Stormworks&#39; Screens.
      <br />
      Here you&#39;ll find important information about the tool!
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>      Notes about shapes:
</b>
      <br />
      Please have in mind that what you see displayed in this tool, often will not match what you see in-game, despite my best efforts.
      <br />
      Always double check how things are looking in-game, especially with triangles and circles.
      <br />
      <br />
      -Line: OK, slightly different at odd angles.
      <br />
      -Triangle: OK, slightly different at odd angles.
      <br />
      -TriangleF: OK, slightly different at odd angles.
      <br />
      -Circle: Doesn&#39;t always match, more so with larger circles.
      <br />
      -CircleF: Doesn&#39;t match at all (cause in-game circleF is an ugly monster).
      <br />
      <br />
      I was not always able to replicate Stormworks&#39; way of drawing shapes, sometimes because it&#39;s hard, sometimes
      <br />
      because I couldn&#39;t be bothered... like with the ugly circles in-game that aren&#39;t even circles.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>      Options Explained:
</b>
      <br />
      -Color Fix: Does some math on the colors so they match better in SW screens. Gamma Fix function by XLjedi.
      <br />
      -Compact: Reduces the number of characters in a script by minimizing function names, e.g: sc = screen.setColor.
      <br />
      -Filled-Shape Fix: AMD and NVIDIA draw full rectangles/triangles differently. By adding 0.5 to the Y position, we fix it for both cards.
      <br />
      -Function Mode: Takes the entire drawing, turns it into a function with (x,y) parameters so you can move it around with your script. e.g: you what the same graphic at different places. Such as a button or icon.
      <br />
      -Color Grouping: Groups shapes by color, ignoring the order you drew them. Uncheck this if you have complex patterns or in-game doesn&#39;t look as it should.
